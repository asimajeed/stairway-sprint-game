# Stairway Sprint

Stairway Sprint is my first project utilizing TypeScript and React, developed as a web-based game. Initially created as a simple JavaScript project, I decided to challenge myself by incorporating more advanced concepts and tools to enhance my learning experience.

## Project Overview

Stairway Sprint is a skill-based game that rewards players for precision as they attempt to toss a ball up a series of stair steps. The game leverages realistic physics for movement and collision detection, utilizing libraries such as Three.js and Cannon.js within a React framework.

### Features

- **Randomly Generated Stairs**: Each game session offers a unique challenge with stairs generated at random positions.
- **Physics-Based Movement**: The ball's trajectory and collisions are governed by physics, delivering a realistic and engaging gameplay experience.
- **Interactive Controls**: Players can click and drag to launch the ball in different directions, adding a layer of strategy to the game.
- **Online Leaderboard**: The Online Leaderboard allows players to submit and compare their high scores in real-time.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes and devices.

### Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing game state.
- **Three.js**: For rendering 3D graphics.
- **Cannon.js**: For physics simulation.
- **TypeScript**: To ensure type safety and improve code quality.

## How to Play

1. **Launch the Game**: Open the game in your web browser. You can access the deployed game [here](https://asimajeed.github.io/stairway-sprint-game) _(work in progress)_.
2. **Control the Ball**: Click on the ball, drag in the direction you want to launch it, and release to send it on its way.
3. **Ascend the Stairs**: Use the physics-based controls to navigate the ball up the stairs, aiming to achieve the highest score possible.

## Upcoming Enhancements

- **Complete the Base Game**: Finalize game mechanics, including the addition of diverse materials.
- **Enhanced Graphics**: Improve visual appeal with better textures, lighting effects, and color schemes.
- **Sound Effects**: Introduce sound effects to enrich the gameplay experience.
- **Leaderboard**: Implement a leaderboard to track top scores and foster competition among players.
