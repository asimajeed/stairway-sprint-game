# First Web Game

_(previously 'simple-js')_

My first project where I learn TypeScript and React to create a web game.

I was initially planning on creating a simple JavaScript project. However, I felt that I had already done similar things and wanted something more challenging.

## Project Overview

This project is a skill-based game where players are rewarded for their precision and must toss a ball up a stair steps. The game incorporates physics for realistic movement and collision detection, using libraries such as Three.js and Cannon.js but with React.

### Features

- **Randomly Generated Stairs**: Each game session presents a unique challenge with stairs generated at random positions.
- **Physics-Based Movement**: The ball's movement and collisions are simulated using physics for a realistic gameplay experience.
- **Interactive Controls**: Players can click and drag to launch the ball in different directions.

### Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing the game state.
- **Three**: For rendering 3D graphics.
- **Cannon**: For physics simulation.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and enhanced code quality.

## How to Play

1. **Launch the Game**: Open the game in a web browser, deployed on this [link](https://asimmaj.github.io/first-web-game) _(work in progress)_.
2. **Navigate the Ball**: Click on the ball, drag in the desired direction, and release to launch the ball.
3. **Climb the Stairs**: Use the physics-based controls to navigate the ball up the stairs and achieve the highest score possible.

## To do:

- **Complete the base game**: Add different materials.
- **Enhanced Graphics**: Improve the visual appeal of the game with better textures and lighting effects + improve colors.
- **Sound Effects**: Add sound effects to enhance the gameplay experience.
- **Leaderboard**: Implement a leaderboard to display top scores and encourage competition among players.
- **Make design more responsive**
